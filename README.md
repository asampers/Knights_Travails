# Knights_Travails
Build a function showing the shortest possible way to get a knight from one square to another on a chess board.

1) Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
2) Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. 3) Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.
4) Choose a search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like.
